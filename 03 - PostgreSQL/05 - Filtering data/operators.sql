--- AND
SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE 
	age_certificate = '18' 
	AND movie_lang = 'English'


--- OR
SELECT * FROM movies

	OR movie_lang = 'English'
ORDER BY 
	movie_lang;

SELECT * FROM movies

--- Combining OR and AND
--- Always use parantheses while using combine OR and AND 

SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE 
	(movie_lang = 'English' 
	OR movie_lang = 'Chinese')
	AND age_certificate = '12'  --- Order Matter with Parantheses

--- Hierarchy of query
--- SELECT FROM WHERE ORDER BY 

--- AND operation is process first then OR 

--- if we do not use parentheses then Postgre execute AND like Multiplication and
--- OR like Addition 7 * 7 + 1 = 50

--- where can only be used after from
select * from movies
where movie_lang = 'English'

--- we can use order by only after where
select * from movies where age_certificate = '15' order by movie_lang


--- We can not use name Alias in where clause 

SELECT 
	first_name,
	last_name AS surname
FROM actors

	surname = 'Allen'


SELECT 
	first_name,
	last_name AS surname
